Just built an ML-powered career recommendation system using real machine learning!

What makes it special:
- Uses scikit-learn LogisticRegression (not just rule-based matching)
- Trained on 2,000+ user-career pairs
- Analyzes 150+ features (skills, interests, values, constraints)
- Provides explainable recommendations with confidence scores
- Integrates O*NET + BLS data (real wage/growth projections)

Real Example:
Sarah (Marketing → Tech transition)
Skills: Writing, Speaking, Critical Thinking
Interests: Enterprising, Investigative

ML Recommendations:
1. Network & Computer Systems Administrators (91% match, $96,800/yr)
2. Computer Network Support Specialists (85% match, $73,340/yr)

The model identified careers that leverage her communication + analytical skills while aligning with tech interests.

How it works:
1. User provides skills/interests/values
2. System builds 150+ dimensional feature vector
3. ML model predicts match probability (learned patterns, not just similarity)
4. Returns ranked recommendations with explanations

Tech Stack:
- scikit-learn LogisticRegression
- O*NET Database 30.1
- BLS Employment Projections
- FastAPI backend

Verified: All ML tests passed - confirmed real ML (coefficients, predictions, different from baseline)

This demonstrates real-world ML application in career development - helping people find paths that match their unique profile.
