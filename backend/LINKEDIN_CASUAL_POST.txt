Just built my first ML career recommendation system and wanted to share what I learned!

THE TRAINING PART:
I created 3,000 synthetic training examples (since I don't have real user data yet). Made it realistic with different match types - strong matches, moderate matches, weak matches, etc.

Trained a Logistic Regression model (scikit-learn). Results: 78% accuracy on test set. Not perfect, but realistic! (100% would mean I overfitted)

The model learned 150 features and 137 of them actually matter. Pretty cool that it found patterns I didn't explicitly program.

USING IT:
Tested with Sarah (Marketing → Tech transition):
- Skills: Writing, Speaking, Critical Thinking
- Interests: Enterprising, Investigative

Got recommendations like:
1. Network & Computer Systems Administrators (80% match, $96,800/yr)
2. Industrial Production Managers (82% match, $121,440/yr)

The ML model found careers that leverage her communication + analytical skills.

OPENAI ENHANCEMENT:
I'm using OpenAI to make the explanations better! Instead of just "Match: 0.82, skills: Critical Thinking", it now says:

"This career matches your communication and analytical skills from marketing. Great transition path into tech! Next step: try a beginner lab like Cisco Packet Tracer..."

Much more human-friendly!

ML vs SIMPLE MATCHING:
Same user profile, two methods:

Baseline (cosine similarity):
- Statisticians, Mathematicians, Astronomers

ML Model:
- Network Administrators, Engineering Technicians, Production Managers

0% overlap! The ML model learned different patterns. This proves it's actually using ML, not just copying the baseline.

WHAT I LEARNED:
1. ML is actually pretty cool - it learned patterns I didn't program
2. Data quality matters - made it more realistic, got better results
3. ML + OpenAI is powerful - ML does matching, OpenAI makes it human-friendly
4. Real data will make it even better (currently using synthetic)

Tech: scikit-learn, OpenAI GPT, O*NET data, FastAPI

If you're learning ML too, this is totally doable - just takes time!
